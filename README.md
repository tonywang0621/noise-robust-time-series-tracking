# Week 1 – Data Generation and Visualization

## Motivation
In many real-world time-series problems, the true system state evolves over time but cannot be directly observed due to noise. 
Instead, we only have access to noisy measurements that partially reflect the underlying state.

Before applying any estimation or machine learning method, it is crucial to understand how such data is generated and how noise affects observations.

This week focuses on building a simple noisy dynamic system and visualizing the relationship between the hidden state and noisy observations.

## System Description
We consider a one-dimensional discrete-time dynamic system with the following assumptions:

### Hidden State (Process Model)
The true system state evolves as a random walk:

$x_{t+1} = x_t + w_t,\quad w_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, Q)$


where:
- $\(x_t\)$ is the hidden (unobserved) true state,
- $\(w_t\)$ is the process noise,
- $\(Q\)$ controls how much the true state fluctuates over time.

### Observation Model
The observed measurement is a noisy version of the true state:

$y_t = x_t + v_t, \quad v_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, R)$




where:
- $y_t\$ is the observed value,
- $\(v_t\)$ is the measurement noise,
- $\(R\)$ controls the noise level of the observation.

## Data Generation
Synthetic time-series data is generated by:
1. Simulating the hidden state sequence using the random walk model.
2. Adding Gaussian measurement noise to produce noisy observations.

Both process noise variance $\(Q\)$ and measurement noise variance $\(R\)$ are adjustable to study their effects.

---

## Visualization
We visualize:
- The hidden true state as a continuous line.
- The noisy observations as scattered points.

This comparison highlights the key challenge of time-series tracking:
> Noisy observations do not directly reveal the true system state.

---

## Key Observations
From the visualization:
- Larger $\(Q\)$ leads to a more volatile true state.
- Larger $\(R\)$ results in noisier observations.
- Noisy measurements alone can be misleading without considering the underlying dynamics.

## Next Step
In Week 2, we will apply simple baseline methods (naive estimation, moving average, and regression-based approaches) to estimate the hidden state and evaluate their performance.
